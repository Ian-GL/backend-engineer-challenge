# Backend Work Sample

In real life, we will soon be working to change how we collect usage data.
This will allow us to redo our Billing system to be more accurate, provide smarter invoicing, and better billing tools for our customers.
In this project we're looking to exercise some of your thought process and understand how you'd approach some of the billing problem.

We want you to build on this simple invoicing system.
All you have here is an incomplete Invoice model.
We want you to build out the model we'd use for the Invoice Items (line items) in an invoice,
as well as the basic logic for syncing the data with the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

## What are we looking for?

* Database modeling skill
* Understanding of Rails
* Good strategy for syncing data with Stripe in a reliable, recoverable way

## Finishing up

Add a NOTES.md to your project that explains clearly:
* What types of End-User UX things come to mind with this project?
  Is there anything you would call out or focus on to make the expierence better for users?
* What is left to do to take a concept like this to production? What are the next steps?
* Do you have any feedback for us? What did you like? What could we do better?
* Other comments?
